## About the Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)

The **Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)** is a prestigious annual programming contest designed to challenge and inspire high school students across Canada and beyond. It is hosted by the **Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing (CEMC)** at the University of Waterloo. The competition is divided into multiple levels, with the **Senior division** being targeted at more advanced students who possess strong algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

The problems posed in the Senior division are known for their rigor and demand for creative solutions, covering topics from graph theory and dynamic programming to string manipulation and computational geometry.

## Why This Repository?

Preparing for competitive programming contests like the CCC can be daunting. This repository is my way of organizing solutions while reinforcing concepts learned through practice. By sharing this work publicly, I hope it helps others on their journey to mastering competitive programming.

The problems encourage not just coding proficiency but also the ability to think critically and devise optimal strategies under time constraintsâ€”skills invaluable in both academic and professional realms.
